01Jul01 Filled downtown buildings with loot and monsters
01Jul01 Terrain: Skyscraper, Sky_Doorway
01Jul01 Sprite: panelcmd sides NRFL and emitcmd allow the building of

01Jun24 Created CALevel
01Jun24 Ruins: suburb, downtown

01Jun18 [M]ap: show world and sector maps.

01Jun03 Merged Script and Effect into one class
01Jun03 -hack starts you just outside a temple with some minimal equip, but
        no money.
01Jun03 Fixed skill gain bug: it added 1 to the default level of -5!

01May26 Critters now resent it when you attack their friends in their sight,
        and like you when you attack their enemies.
01May26 friendSpecies groups: "minions", "humans", etc.
01May26 Added size to Entities; small critters can move through trees and
        cannot be attacked while under that cover.
01May26 Show NPCs fighting
01May26 Level.getThings()
01May26 Terrain: Stone_Window
01May26 Terrain.opaque, Thing.isOpaque()
01May26 Brain: B_Autopilot
01May26 Started building Mogth-cult temples

01May20 Made better forest and mountain sectors
01May20 Player turns are done first in nextTurn, and they are not given a turn
        with the critters; this gives you until your next turn to do things if
        you die.  This was already the case if you were north or due west of
        your attacker, I just generalized it.  This helps a lot when playing
        just one or two characters - "damn, where'd those emergency chocolates
        go?"
01May20 Red stipple over dying characters, improved color-coded stat summary
01May20 Model: zombie (crap), bloody_bones (major improvement), baron, spider

01May19 Ranged attacks now choose from a menu of all legal shots.  Targets no
        longer block each other, but that feature produced too many false hits
        from entities filling an entire grid anyway...
01May19 place towns (WORLDSIZE/8 plus the starting town) next to water 90% of
        the time
01May19 Model: soldier, cultist
01May19 Moved all Entity construction into Bestiary module.
01May19 NPCs with guns get to shoot back if they make a Speed roll.
01May19 NPCs can pick things up if they've got nothing better to do.
01May19 List repeating items in status and inventory as "%s (x%d)"
01May19 Starting town is fairly peaceful (except for all the damn rats), other
        towns are much meaner.  Son, don't take your gun to town.
01May19 Show blood splatters when you get wounded
01May19 Different critters have different food values as a corpse.
01May19 Encounters for all terrain types
01May19 Critters: remaining townsfolk, cultists

01May13 Drop cash where there already is cash should just add to that cash
01May13 class Cash(Loot)
01May13 Umbra.selectTarget
01May13 View Char menu: "Hand Item to NPC"
01May13 Ranged combat
01May13 class Ammo(Loot)
01May13 Models: gun, ammo

01May12 Brain: B_Coward
01May12 Doors, supposedly the same instance, did not always have the same state
        on different levels.  This is a bad idea, anyway, since they'll have
        different locations but supposedly be the same object.  Door.linkedTo
        holds the coord of a matched Door to change state in lockstep.
01May12 Show secondary stats for all PCs in the character frame, replacing the
        buttons.
01May12 Set system-wide colors - black and green!

01May10 Added food effects
01May10 Game should not store its name, because that is used to determine the
        save path.

01May06 Created Melee, Ranged, and Defense subclasses of Equip
01May06 Created Skills: Melee, Ranged, Dodge, Locksmith, Repair, Science,
        Magic, Archaeology
01May06 Added starting skills to Entities based on Profession
01May06 Experience, levels, skill gain (currently random until schools are in)
01May06 Created Effect: stat
01May06 Main Menu: "Attack": prompts each character for an action: Pass, Melee
01May06 Combat: strike, dodge, and armor
01May06 Entity.defense=0, .unarmed=Fisticuffs
01May06 Brain: B_Still, B_Hunter
01May06 Entity.friendSpecies, friendliness (very basic)
01May06 Renamed Wizard to Arcanist
01May06 Handled player death
01May06 GameOverException
01May06 Move status text off view window and into a label

01May05 Bound arrow keys to move buttons in addition to Roguelike keys.
01May05 Merchants
01May05 Added "Jack of all Trades" profession, who get a 20% xp bonus but have
        no starting skills.
01May05 Shops
01May05 Enforced MAXITEMS limit better
01May05 Line wrapping with util.foldLines()

01May04 Refactored Canvas3D out of UmbraTk

01May03 Moved indoors door just outside of the buildings, added Into_Darkness
        terrain.
01May03 Rearranged the user interface to put the controls on the right
01May03 Added Terrain.Into_Darkness to make the inside of doors black.

01Apr29 Moved status to a pair of labels above the view, no redraws needed to
        make them update - hooray!
01Apr29 Created buttons for the main menu and characters.
01Apr29 Moved most of the level construction to Sector, so __makeTown could
        work on two levels at once.
01Apr29 Minimal scripting, ECHO and TELEPORT
01Apr29 Created indoors level for town, with teleports back and forth.
01Apr29 class Door(Thing.Thing), trigger opens and closes them.
01Apr29 Scale stars so changing the screen size doesn't leave a black spot in
        the sky.
01Apr29 Cash

01Apr28 Wasted a day installing SuSE 7.1, broke everything.  Bah.

01Apr23 Turning does not cost a turn now, since it doesn't cost other Entities
        anything.

01Apr22 Entity.gender and .species
01Apr22 Encounter tables for plains and town
01Apr22 Entities wander aimlessly on turns when they make a Speed roll.
01Apr22 Entity.brain is a key from Brain, choosing among module functions:
            bob.brain=Brain.slackBrain
            Brain.think(bob)
01Apr22 Movement blocked by other Entities
01Apr22 Created Rabbit, Rat, Bloody Bones, Lunatic, and Boss sprites

01Apr21 util.d() handles negative dice, negating the entire roll.
01Apr21 Added -size <n> option to UmbraTk
01Apr21 Added -nodebug option to Umbra
01Apr21 Added Get to main menu
01Apr21 Created Sprite, converted most of Terrain

01Apr21 Filled in the rest of the town
01Apr21 Created a swarm of humans with silly names in town

01Apr15 Change the sky, sun, and moon by time of day.  Eclipses are possible!
        Constellations of stars are generated when a game is created.

01Apr14 Changed Thing.loc to __coord=Int, since the Sector is always known.
        __coord=(levelnum<<20)|(y<<10)|x
        Level uses:
            __terrain=String[]
            __stuff=List{}
        Removed Grid
        This speeds up load/save times and reduces memory usage.
01Apr14 Added altitude and height to drawBlock; used those to simplify
        drawStoneRooftop()
01Apr14 Optimize loadGame, saveGame:
        saveSector(save/a/128_128.sec) took     99ms
        saveGame(save/a/game.dat)
        saveGame(save/a/game.dat) took          199ms
        loadGame(save/a/game.dat)
        loadGame(a) took                        2520ms
        loadSector(save/a/128_128.sec) took     3109ms
        saveSector(save/a/128_129.sec) took     139ms
        saveGame(save/a/game.dat)
        saveGame(save/a/game.dat) took          199ms
01Apr14 Mountains, Hills, Marsh, Desert (aka beach), and Forest sectors.
01Apr14 Optimized loadSector, saveSector:
        saveSector(save/b/128_128.sec) took     10ms
        saveGame(save/b/game.dat)
        saveGame(save/b/game.dat) took          210ms
        loadGame(save/b/game.dat)
        loadGame(b) took                        2589ms
        loadSector(save/b/128_128.sec) took     180ms
        saveSector(save/b/128_128.sec) took     19ms
        saveGame(save/b/game.dat)
        saveGame(save/b/game.dat) took          190ms
        Pickling long lists of items is VERY slow!!!

01Apr11 Game menu: New Game, Load Game, Copy Game, Delete Game, Quit
        Allows cancel of New Game, etc.

01Apr08 View Char menu: "Trade Item to Another PC"
01Apr08 Put grey walls at extreme edge of vision for "fog", if the -fog
        command-line argument is given.
01Apr08 Use [wy*WORLDSIZE+wx] for sector types
01Apr08 Do not keep everything in memory.  Page out any Sector you are not
        currently in.
01Apr08 Movement between Sectors
01Apr08 Load and save works on subdirs of db
01Apr08 Land sectors have a rim of clear terrain to enter.
01Apr08 Game.__makeSectors produces a whole random planet.
01Apr08 Minimalistic polygon art for Hill, Tree, Bush, Equip, Entity, and
        Water.  It's bleak, sterile, and cubist, but kinda compelling, like
        the Teletubbies world...
01Apr08 Created ponds in Plains - without bridges, I can't afford to do
        rivers.

01Apr07 Main Menu: "Step Left", "Step Right", "Turn Back"
01Apr07 Create loot and equipment
01Apr07 Implement Thing.draw()
01Apr07 View Char Menu: "Get Item", "Examine", "Use Item", "Remove Equipment",
        "Drop Item"

01Apr07 -viewdist command line option

01Apr01 Implemented pseudo-3-D with colored polygons
01Apr01 Took Terrain references out of Grid
01Apr01 Replaced Coord with Level ref and Int (y<<16)|x

01Mar31 Put facing in Game
        01Apr08 Removed it with getFacing() from party[0]
01Mar31 Replaced move North/East/South/West with:
        Step Forward
        Turn Left
        Turn Right
        Step Back
01Mar31 Started on 3D graphics code
01Mar31 Refactored generic Tk stuff and testing out of UmbraTk

01Mar29 Improved the Town generator, still only makes main road and keep.

01Mar25 Implemented character creation, main menu up through basic movement,
        showMap and showCharacter (both very primitive right now).

01Mar24 Restored to the desktop, implemented framework and initial menus.

01Mar18-01Mar23 Worked on it on my PalmPilot all week.

01Mar17 Created.

{_Design_Notes___________________________}

Concept:

- A *simple* computer role-playing game.  The world is randomly-generated, but
there is an eventual goal.  Heavily influenced by roguelike games, Alternate
Reality, and console RPGs like Lunar 2.

- Single view.  There are a couple of roguelike games with wilderness levels
(Omega and ADOM), but they use pregenerated world maps, use a different scale
for it, and have different actions available.  The original Ultima games had
3-D wireframe for the dungeons, but tile-based wilderness...
    I want the player to ALWAYS see the world at the same scale, from the same
perspective, with the same controls.  Likewise, console games switch to a
battle map for fights; that should happen in your normal view.

- THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE:
    Simplicity of gameplay is more important than realism.

- Set after a magical apocalypse, the Great Old Ones, led by Mogth, have
reclaimed the Earth from the infestation of Humanity.

- Goal: gain enough power to defeat Mogth and free Humanity or escape the
planet.

- Gameplay: move, use item, use skill/power/spell, talk/trigger, attack,
menu.

- The world is 2-D, 256*256 sectors.

- Sectors consist of an overall terrain type and 1 or more levels, counted
from 0 up, whether the levels are a dungeon or a tower.

- Levels are 2-D, 64*64 grids.  Grids are 2m*2m*2m.

- Yes, this is really huge.  32km square, in fact.

- Levels may have Zones, which run every turn the player is on that level.

- View shows pseudo-3-D, with a 90&deg; POV.  Things have one or four 256x256
sprites.

- Combat happens from your POV.  Weapons can hit Entities in a 180&deg; FH arc.

- Equipment (weapons, armor, rings, etc.) is readied when "used", and has
constant effects.

- Loot must be "used" to do anything, triggers an effect when used, and may be
one-shot or permanent.

- Items which are not Loot or Equip cannot be taken, but can be triggered.

- PCs & NPCs use the same classes, Game controls party members, AI controls
NPCs.

{_Goals__________________________________}

There are two goals:
1. Defeat Mogth
    - collect weapons, armor, artifacts
    - increase in power
    - gather allies & armies
    - go to confront Mogth
    - "kill" it
    - it rises from death, destroys humanity as you watch
    - get destroyed & devoured
    - fade to black

2. Lead Humanity Off Earth
    - find the starport & clear it of monsters
    - collect operation & repair manuals and spare parts
    - repair the starship
    - gather allies & refugees
    - escape, see any left behind get destroyed and devoured
    - land on New Earth
    - as a cut scene: past trees from landing site, see a temple of Mogth,
    hear mocking laughter
    - fade to black
